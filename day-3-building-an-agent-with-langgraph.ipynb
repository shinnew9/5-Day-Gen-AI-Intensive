It will provide a looping chat interface to customers where they can order cafe beverages using natural language, and you will build nodes to represent the cafe's live menu and the \"back room\"ordering system.\n\nBaristaBot is used in other Gemini API demos, so if you are looking to explore something with a more minimal implementation, check out the [BaristaBot function calling example](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/Agents_Function_Calling_Barista_Bot.ipynb) that implements a similar system using only the Gemini API Python SDK and function calling.\n\n## **IMPORTANT!**\nThe app built in this notebook takes **user input** using a **text box** ([Python's `input`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input)).

Keep an eye out for the steps where you need to uncomment the `.invoke(...)` calls in order to interact with the app.\n\nIf you with to save a verion of this notebook with `Save and Run all`, you will need to **re-comment** the lines you commented out to ensure that the ntoebook can run without human input.\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get set up\n\nStart by installing and importing the LangGraph SDK and LangChain support for the Gemini API.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Remove conflicting packages from the kaggle base environment.\n!pip uninstall -qqy kfp jupyterlab libpysal think spacy fastai ydata-profiling google-cloud-bigquery google-generativeai\n# Install langgraph and the packages used in this lab.\n!pip install -qU 'langgraph==0.3.21', 'langchain-google-genai==2.1.2' 'langgraph-prebuilt==0.1.7'","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-06T00:48:49.883302Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-06T00:48:49.883618Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-06T00:49:12.078879Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-06T00:48:49.883585Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-06T00:49:12.078042Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[33mWARNING: Skipping kfp as it is not installed.\u001b[0m\u001b[33m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[33mWARNING: Skipping think as it is not installed.\u001b[0m\u001b[33m\n\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m43.5/43.5 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m1.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m138.0/138.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m5.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m42.0/42.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m2.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.4/1.4 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m30.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m423.3/423.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m24.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m42.0/42.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m2.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m47.2/47.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m2.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m223.6/223.6 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m13.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[?25h\u001b[31mERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.

As the developer, you define an application graph that models the state transitions for your application. Your app will define a **state** schema, and an instance of that schema is propagated through the graph.\n\nEach **node** in the graph represents an action or step that can be taken. Nodes will make changes to the state in some way through code that you defines.\n\nEach **edge** in the graph represents a transition between states, defining the flow of the program. Edge transitions can be fixed, for example if you define a text-only chatbot where output is wlays displayed to a user, you may always transition form `chatbot -> user`. The transitions can also be conditional, allowing you add branching ( like an `if-else` statement) or looping (like `for` or `while` loops).\n\nLangGraph is highly extensible and provides a number of features that are not part of this tutorial such as memory, persistance and streaming. To better undersatnd the key concepts and philosophies behing LangGraph, check out their [Conceptual guides](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/) and [High-level overview](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Define core instructions\n\nState is a fundamental concept for a LangGraph app. A state object is passed between every node and transition in the app. Here you define a state object `OrderState`, that holds the conversation history, a structured order, and a flag indicating if the customer has finished placing their order. For simplicity, the \"structure\" in this order is just a list of strings, but this can be expanded to andy Python data structure.\n\nIn Python, the LangGraph state objct is a Python [dictionary]. You can provide a schema for this dictionary by defining it as a 'TypedDict'.\n\nHere you also define the system instruction that the Gemini model will use.

You should try and build out your own ideas, but for some inspiration, consider:\n- Adding more structure the order (`OrderState.order`) -e.g. separate fields for item, modifiers and even quantity.\n- Currently the model can only cealr and re-add items, so add a function a `remove_item`s from the order.\n- Try building a UI that displays the in-progress order and hosts the chat. Frameworks like  [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) or [Mesop](https://google.github.io/mesop/) are great for this.\n\nThis system works well for a single person ordering, but agentic systems can interact with many sources. For a big stretch exercise, try and extend this app to run at a specific schedule, and contact you friends or colleagues over  [Chat](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest) to collect their daily coffee orders.\n\n*- [Mark McD](https://linktr.ee/markmcd)*","metadata":{}}]}
